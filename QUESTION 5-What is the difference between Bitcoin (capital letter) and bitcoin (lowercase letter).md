## What is the difference between Bitcoin (capital letter) and bitcoin (lowercase letter)? ##

We have said that Bitcoin is a whole new monetary system but it is also possible to indicate with this name the digital &quot;currency&quot; that runs within this system.

The term **Bitcoin** usually refers to the entire system, including the code and the protocols, while the term **bitcoin** , with the lowercase b, means the actual coin that runs inside it.

We will see later how in reality those who participate in this monetary system do not exchange files (or tokens) called bitcoins, and that therefore there is no currency in the classic sense of the term, but for the moment we take this simplification for good.

We must learn immediately to distinguish these two terms.

In fact we may want to talk about technology without talking about the monetary asset or vice versa, depending on the context.

In order to distinguish these two terms, lately we are trying to name the system &quot; **Bitcoin Protocol**&quot; or BP, while as regards the currency, we are trying to push for the adoption of the term &quot; **satoshi**&quot;, the basic monetary unit that has earned its name only following the disappearance of the Bitcoin project creator, or alternatively we can use the term **BTC** , which represents a whole bitcoin.
