**Some of the most common terms in the industry.**


Bear market: definition used to describe the periods in which the market is falling. Usually these are extended periods of time, typically months.

Blockstream Satellite network: a network of satellites created by the Blockstream company in order to send valid Bitcoin blocks to Earth. The aim is to offer Bitcoin a mesh network for its proper functioning, without using the Internet.

Broadcast system: Bitcoin, in its base layer meaning, is often referred to as a broadcast system because, although transactions travel without the direct intervention of a reliable third party, miners are in charge of transcribing them into the blockchain. However, it is not possible to censor transactions because, if a miner did not include them in a block, they would still be included by someone else in a subsequent block.

Bug: error in writing software that can cause systemic malfunctions or crashes.

Capital control: measures taken by central authorities to regulate the flow of money into and out of the state economy.

Change: the rest of a Bitcoin transaction. Bitcoin uses the UTXO model, so each transaction corresponds to a certain number of unspent bitcoins (outputs) used as input to the latter.
 Let&#39;s imagine that Alice has to send 1 BTC to Bob and her wallet has 1.25 BTC as unspent bitcoins (output). Alice will send Bob the entire output of 1.25 BTC, pay a variable mining commission (for example 0.0001 BTC) and Bob will hold 1 BTC. Alice will then receive 0.2499 BTC as the transaction change, usable for the next expenses.

Circulating supply: the amount of bitcoins in circulation at this time. All the bitcoins generated up to this point are considered, although the actual circulating supply should consider bitcoins whose keys have not been lost and which are therefore expendable.

CoinJoin: system used to increase the fungibility of Bitcoin transactions on blockchain. CoinJoin combines multiple payments from different senders in a single transaction.

Cold Wallet: typically offline wallet, on which most of our wealth in satoshi should be preserved.

Deflation: economic phenomenon opposed to inflation. Decrease in the price of goods or services for an extended period of time. Causes the increase in the purchasing power of the currency.

Difficulty adjustment: A miner closes a block on average every 10 minutes. The calculation of the Proof of Work involves a variable difficulty which means that the average time of discovery of the blocks is precisely 10 minutes. This difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, about two weeks.
 If, in this interval of time, the hashrate of the miners has increased to the point of reducing the time of discovery of the blocks to less than 10 minutes, then the difficulty will increase, if instead the average time is greater than 10 minutes it will be reduced.

Fiat: legal currencies, with a forced market, in which the rule of inconvertibility between banknotes and any precious metals held by the State applies. An example of fiat money is given by the Dollar, the Euro and the Pound. Almost all the classical currencies in circulation are fiat.

FOMO: literally Fear Of Missing Out, or fear of being cut off. Indicates the anxiety that is typically generated in periods in which the price of an asset, and therefore also bitcoin, increases rapidly. Many are drawn to buy from this sudden price increase, hoping to generate a profit just as quickly.

FUD: Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt, represent the dissemination of information, even false or otherwise manipulated in order to reduce the price of an asset or discourage its purchase.

Gold Standard: monetary system in which currencies are representations of a certain amount of gold and are convertible. Until 1971 the Dollar was &quot;backed by gold&quot;, ie it represented a certain amount of gold stored in the Federal Reserve vaults.

Halving: division by two. In Bitcoin it indicates the halving of the subsidy to the miner who discovers a new block and takes place about every four years, that is after 210,000 blocks, starting from block 0 called Genesis Block. Currently (2019) the reward is 12.5 bitcoins and will become 6.25 BTC in 2020. Bitcoin inflation increases with this reduction.

Hash: non-invertible mathematical function. Thanks to it, it is possible to transform a string of data of arbitrary length into a string of predefined length.

Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet (HD Wallet): a wallet that generates new receiving addresses each time one is used to receive funds. This type of wallet allows you to control theoretically infinite addresses using a single main private key (Master Private Key). Hierarchical deterministic wallets are useful in increasing the privacy level of blockchain transactions.

HODL: neologism that indicates the action of saving bitcoins trying not to spend them. The user who acts in this way defines himself as a hodler.

Inflation: price inflation means increase in the price of goods or services over an extended period of time. Causes the decrease in the purchasing power of the currency. Monetary inflation means increase in the supply of a monetary system.

Master Private Key: main private key of a hierarchical deterministic wallet. Through the Master Private Key it is possible to derive all the past and future addresses of the wallet.

Mesh network: a decentralized connection system that uses nodes that act as receivers, transmitters and repeaters. A mesh network may not need to be connected to the Internet.

Seed phrase: a list of words (typically 12 or 24) randomly generated by our wallet. These words, put in sequence, allow the wallet to generate all the addresses linked to a specific Master Private Key.

Shitcoin: alternative cryptocurrencies are often referred to as altcoin or shitcoin. The decentralization and security features of Bitcoin are often reduced or eliminated in favor of the speed of blockchain transactions.

Smart contract: digital contracts regulated by protocols, which do not require direct human intervention for their execution.

Ticker: the symbol used to identify an asset in the market. Bitcoin ticker is BTC

Token: typically an asset that is hosted by another blockchain.
 There are tokens whose mission is to be considered real cryptocurrencies, others are utilities. Some represent a project that in the future could have its own mainet (a proprietary blockchain) and will be exchanged with the assets of this mainet typically in a 1:1 ratio. Other tokens allow you to purchase the goods and/or services of the project in question. Finally, there are definable security tokens which, like the classic stock market, represent a participation in the project, in terms of dividends, profits, governance, etc.

Total supply: the total bitcoins that will be put into circulation. We know this quantity and we know in which block this will be reached, even if not the precise time. The predictability of Bitcoin is one of its fundamental characteristics.

Whales: a great market player. Typically, when a &quot;whale&quot; sells or buys large sums of money, the market suffers more or less markedly. In finance these players are sometimes identified with the term &quot;shark&quot;, although by this definition we mean an actor who acts aggressively on the market even without having the capital of the so-called whales.
