&quot;_(...) there are problems with the actual use of digital cash in the near term.(...) One concern I have is that the move to electronic payments will decrease personal privacy by making it easier to log and record transactions._

_Dossiers could be built up which would track the spending patterns of each of us._

_Already, when I order something over the phone or using my Visa card, to record exactly how I spent and where I spent it. As time goes on, more transactions may be done this way, and the net result could be a great loss of privacy.&quot;_

- _Hal Finney, Digital Cash &amp; Privacy, 19 Aug 93_

The invention of money is what started the trade between individuals and, since then, has permeated our society.

We cannot do without it, but we can learn to evaluate, independently, which money is good and which is bad, which medium of exchange is functional and which is not.

With the arrival of digital payment systems we have increasingly focused on the functionality of money, on the speed with which it can be used, facilitating transactions and eliminating obstacles to its spread.

However, we have forgotten to evaluate whether the money we are using is a good medium of exchange and we have underestimated the threats to privacy that these new systems entail.

Yet the signs were all there.

The possibility for governments to create value from nothing, printing money completely disconnected from any underlying, be it gold or other precious and scarce material, has now become the standard for some decades. From a medium of exchange in the hands of the individual, money has become over time the exclusive preserve of states and central banks.

The threats to privacy were instead fully manifested at the very moment when the Internet was created: governments could finally carry out the so-called mass surveillance.

To counteract these surveillance systems, which could potentially be used for unethical and anti-democratic purposes, a movement was born composed of individuals who shared a purpose: the creation, through the practical use of cryptography, of systems designed to defend people against potential threats to their freedom.

When the sharing of information via the Internet allowed the advent of electronic payments, further criticalities were added to those already existing. Innovative channels were now available to the Big Brother.

Fortunately someone began, with the proper means of the same new computer systems of payment, to hypothesize another way, a possibility of contrast to the system; in order not to let it get out of the way, so that it does not turn our society into a dystopia.

They worked to make those simple theories into real and valid alternatives.

Today we have a tool that represents the synthesis of this hard work and it is up to us to understand its potential.

&quot;_We are faced with the problems of loss of privacy, creeping computerization, massive databases, more centralization,&quot; and Chaum offers a different direction to go in, rather than governments and corporations.
 The computer can be used to protect people, rather than to control them. Unlike the world of today, where people are organizations or governments, chaum&#39;s approach balances power between individuals and organizations. Both kinds of groups are protected against fraud and mistreatment by the other.
 Naturally, in today&#39;s society, with power allocated so disproportionately, such ideas are a threat to large organizations.
 Balancing power would mean a net loss of power for them.
 So no institution is going to pick up and champion Chaum&#39;s ideas.
 It&#39;s going to be a grass-roots activity, one in which people learn how to do it, and then demand it.(â€¦)
 The work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete.
 It&#39;s important work.
 If things work out well, we may be able to look back and see that it was the most important work we have ever done.&quot;_

- _Hal Finney, Why Remailers I, 15 Nov 92_

&quot;_I don&#39;t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can&#39;t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can&#39;t stop.&quot;_

- _Friedrich Hayek, 1984_
