## Redefining the monetary unit ##

Recognized Bitcoin (or rather LNP/BP) as the only suite of reliable interconnection protocols between users wishing to exchange scarce digital value without resorting to centralized third parties, it is now necessary to solve a semantic problem.

How can we avoid the confusion created by the homonymy between the asset (bitcoin) and the system (Bitcoin)?

A first step could be to call bitcoin (asset) with its acronym (ticker) used in the market: **BTC**.

However, another element of confusion remains, always described above: &quot;_these BTCs are too few and too expensive_!&quot;
 Furthermore, they are not at all suitable for micropayments, ie the vast majority of monetary transactions between individuals.

Therefore another unit of measure is needed, which fortunately already exists but has earned its name only after the disappearance of the Bitcoin project creator: **satoshi (sat)**.

Let&#39;s throw away all the various intermediate units, such as for example the bit (1 millionth of bitcoin, or 100 satoshis) and the mBTC (1 thousandth of bitcoin or 0.001 BTC) and use the basic units, which are understandable for the average user.
