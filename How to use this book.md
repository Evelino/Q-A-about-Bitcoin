**How to use this book**

The chosen formula is that of the questions/answers, therefore, although some topics are addressed in a linear way, it is not necessary to respect the order of the chapters.

My advice is to proceed to a linear first reading, but if you find yourself faced with an unintelligible text, I suggest you skip the chapter and come back to it when you feel ready.

**The words in bold** usually indicate an important term on which we will return during the reading. Therefore, if you find seemingly complex terms, do not fear and continue: we will analyze them later.
